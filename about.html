        <h2 class="about__title">Our Roots</h2>
        <p class="about__description">
          Metro Group Inc. is Utah's premier metal recycling, brokerage, and
          transloading company. The company's roots go all the way back to the
          early 1900s when Morris and Libby Bontsik emigrated from Eastern
          Europe. After arriving in Utah, the Bontsik family earned a living by
          collecting and selling scrap metal from their home in Price, Utah. A
          few years later, the operation was moved to Logan, Utah, where the
          company's first recycling yard was established.
        </p>
        <p class="about__description">
          In 1976, Bill Bond (3rd Generation) expanded the operation out of
          Logan by starting the then-named Metro Steel Distributors in Salt Lake
          City. Originally,
          <img src="images/e0b7b55a-1a89-4fbf-ad82-9d9ef30006b3.jpeg" alt="" />
          the Salt Lake location was primarily a retailer of new steel products,
          however, Bill and his sons, Mark and Jim, quickly realized a need for
          steel recycling services in Salt Lake. Shifting focus from
          distribution to recycling, and after a name change embodying that
          shift, Metro Group Inc. was born. Shortly after implementing the steel
          recycling service in Salt Lake City, Metro Group began recycling other
          non-ferrous (non-steel items such as copper, aluminum, brass, etc.)
          metals as well.
        </p>
        <p class="about__description">
          Later, the company recognized an opportunity to partner with the
          railroad industry in providing freight services to customers who
          didn't have rail facilities. This began the transloading part of the
          business. Now, Metro Transloading serves diverse industries such as
          mining, steel fabrication, building products and construction.
        </p>

          class="our__growth"
        />
        <p class="about__description">
          In 2003, Metro Group acquired two local competitors in order to
          increase its market share and provide more service to its customers.
          Metro acquired additional recycling companies in 2013 and again in
          2016. The company has continued to grow and evolve into the
          multi-million dollar corporation that it is today. Currently, Metro
          Group Inc. has nine locations throughout Utah, Idaho, and Nevada and
          processes nearly 1.5 million pounds of metal each day.
        </p>
        <p class="about__description">
          Metro has secured its place as a leader in the scrap recycling market
          through unsurpassed customer service and a commitment to meeting
          customers' individual needs. Metro serves a vastly diverse group of
          clients all around the United States: from multi-billion dollar
          manufacturers to local individuals recycling cans. Additionally, Metro
          has secured national and international partnerships with metal buyers
          in Asia, Europe, and Latin America.
        </p>
        <p class="about__description">
          Metro Group, Inc. is currently operated by 4th and 5th generation
          family members along with a core team of dedicated employees. One of
          Metro's hallmarks is its commitment to its employees as evidenced by
          the uncharacteristically long average employee tenure. In 1970 Metro
          had 10 employees; today the company employs over 250.
